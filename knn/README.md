Knn - K nearest Neighbours - K number of closest neighbours - knn classification.m
Rnn - Radius based Nearest Neighbours - Number of neighbours in a particular radius - rnn classification.m

The boundaries for both methods can be seen. The classification of data using knn is displayed in knn classification.jpg. 

The value of k can be changed in the multiknnclassification.m.
The hitrate for both classification techniques has been plotted for different values of K and R
