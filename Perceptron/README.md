Perceptron - 1 layer or 1 neuron neural network

Perceptron start.m - Trial of perceptron giving blue or red favoured results
Different values of biases and weights tend to result in different behaviours

Perceptron.m is the main file that trains the perceptron with the training data
Perceptron test.m displays the result based on test data

Error rate vs epochs shows how the perceptron is performing on training data and test data

Perceptron metrics show the hit rate, sensitivity, specificty, NPV's and PPV's that the perceptron results in.
